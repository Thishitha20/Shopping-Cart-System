E-Commerce Shopping Cart 

Project Description
This is a mini Java console-based project** that simulates a simple Shopping Cart System for an e-commerce platform like Amazon/Myntra.  

It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java:

Encapsulation → Product class with private fields and getters.  
Polymorphism → Discount abstract class with two implementations:
FestiveDiscount → 10% off total  
BulkDiscount → 20% off if any product quantity > 5  
Interface → Payment interface with pay(amount) method.  
Collections → ArrayList to manage products in the cart.  

At checkout, the system displays all product details and the final amount payable after applying discounts.
